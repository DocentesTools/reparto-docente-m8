"""HourRequirement table model and response schemas.

Redesigned for the three-stage adaptation (plan §5.9, amended by §20.8): an
``HourRequirement`` is no longer a leadership *input* row (group + subject +
required hours). It is now one **generated, indivisible teacher-position slot**
produced from a :class:`~reparto_service.db_models.teaching_activities.TeachingActivity`
(plan §3.6, §3.7). A co-teaching activity with ``required_teacher_count = 2``
generates two slots (``position_index`` 0 and 1), each of
``required_teacher_hours = teacher_weekly_hours_per_position``; every slot is
assigned to exactly one teacher and can never be split.

Identity and generation lineage (plan §20.8, authoritative over the pre-§20
"generation as identity" wording in §5.9):

* ``id`` is **stable slot identity**; the logical slot is
  ``(teaching_activity_id, position_index)``.
* Active uniqueness is ``(teaching_activity_id, position_index)`` restricted to
  live rows (``retired_generation IS NULL``): a retired slot never blocks its
  successor.
* ``UNIQUE (id, teaching_activity_id)`` backs the composite foreign key the
  redesigned :class:`~reparto_service.db_models.assignments.Assignment` adds
  (plan §20.9) so the DB — not just the application — guarantees an assignment's
  denormalised ``teaching_activity_id`` matches its requirement.
* ``created_generation`` / ``last_validated_generation`` track the plan-wide
  processing generation (``TeachingPlan.current_generation_number``) a slot was
  born in and last re-validated in; ``retired_generation`` (nullable) marks the
  generation that retired it; ``superseded_by_requirement_id`` (nullable) links
  a reconciled assigned slot to the new row that replaced it (plan §20.8).

Requirements are **generated, never manually created or deleted** (plan §5.9,
§20.12): this module therefore exposes read schemas only, plus the
generation-preview / generate result schemas
(:class:`RequirementGenerationPreview` / :class:`RequirementGenerationResult`)
consumed by the plan §7.5 generation flow on
:class:`~reparto_service.controllers.hour_requirements.HourRequirementController`.
The reconciliation-preview / reconcile flow (plan §7.5) is its own later task.

Hour values stay ``float`` like every other hour field in the service today; the
fleet-wide ``Decimal`` / ``NUMERIC(..., 2)`` sweep is a dedicated later task
(plan §3.9).
